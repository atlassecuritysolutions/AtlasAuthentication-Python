## Sell software that can't be shared or read.

**Authorization that holds under active attack.**

Most licensing checks run once, at sign-in, and trust the client after that. Atlas keeps checking. A key locks to the first PC that signs in, and from then on the library proves to the server, on its own threads, that the process is still the one that signed in. Every sign-in, refusal and live session shows up in your dashboard, and you can message, end or ban any of them while the app runs.

This is the Python SDK: a typed, pure `ctypes` binding over a prebuilt `Atlas.dll`. No compiler, no extra dependencies, no servers to run.

## Six layers. One failed layer fails the whole sign-in.

Every request runs the same stack in the same order, cheapest check first.

| Layer | Beats | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Transport** | Interception, replay, floods | A fresh nonce and a keyed tag on every packet, keys derived per request from the machine and the build, and a proof-of-work gate before any license logic. |
| **Identity** | Spoofing one component | Sixteen hardware sources, each kept on its own, so changing one never clears a ban on the rest. |
| **Session** | Cheat Engine, boolean patching | The session id stays encrypted in memory. The auth token is split across four fragments that all have to be right at once. |
| **Client integrity** | x64dbg, WinDbg, IDA, Frida | Debugger, hook, injection and hardware-breakpoint detection, import and code checks, threads hidden from debuggers. Runs for the life of the process, not only at login. |
| **Server proof** | Nulled and cracked servers | Every approval is signed over the client's own nonce, the license and the session. The client exits on a missing signature, with no fallback and no retry. |
| **Server rules** | Patched builds, abuse, sharing | Executable-hash whitelist, VPN and proxy checks, per-IP rate limits and session caps, served from a cache the dashboard invalidates the moment you change anything. |

## What you control

- **Licenses or accounts.** Keys that lock to a machine, or usernames and passwords, per app.
- **Emailed codes.** An 8-digit sign-in code on the policy you pick, from never to every sign-in.
- **Live sessions.** Message, disconnect or kill any session. One ban covers the key, the IP and the hardware.
- **Rules.** Block by country, VPN or device count. Alert rules that act on what they see, with Discord and webhook delivery.
- **Variables, files and entitlements.** Change a value, serve a file or meter a credit without shipping a build.
- **Updates.** Upload a build, promote it, and roll it out to 10% first. Clients verify the SHA-256, swap the file and relaunch.

## Start in minutes

Requirements: Windows 10 or 11 x64 and 64-bit Python 3.9 or newer. The binding ships inline type hints and a `py.typed` marker, so mypy and Pyright check your calls with no stubs.

1. **Create an app.** Sign up at [atlassecurity.site](https://atlassecurity.site), create an application in the dashboard and copy its API key.
2. **Install.** `pip install atlas-auth`
3. **Sign in.**

```python
import sys
import atlas

atlas.API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"      # Dashboard > Applications
atlas.Startup()                     # once, first

if not atlas.License.Login("ATLAS-A9F2K-4RMXM"):
    print(atlas.Data.GetErrorMessage())     # says why
    sys.exit(1)
# signed in
```

Free to start: three applications, 300 users per app, three file uploads per app and the full protection engine. No card. The Console project in this repo is already wired to the package.

| You see | It means |
|---|---|
| `FileNotFoundError: Atlas.dll not found` | The DLL is not beside the `atlas/` package or your app. Point `ATLAS_DLL_PATH` at it. On 1.0.3 and earlier a `pip install` put it in `sys.prefix`, so update. |
| `OSError: [WinError 193] %1 is not a valid Win32 application` | You are running 32-bit Python. Atlas needs 64-bit. |

## Everything else is in the docs

Every call, status code and edge case is documented, with examples in all three languages.

## Shipping

- **Hash whitelist.** Drop the single-file `.exe` PyInstaller produces into **Settings → Builds**, not `python.exe`. Run unpackaged and every user on the same Python build sends the same hash. [More](https://atlassecurity.site/docs?p=concepts/hash-whitelist).
- **Packaging.** `build_exe.bat` in `Console Example/` runs PyInstaller with a spec that bundles `Atlas.dll` into the one file. The exe unpacks to a temporary folder at launch and the binding finds the DLL there. The lookup order is `ATLAS_DLL_PATH`, beside a frozen exe or in its unpack folder, then beside the `atlas/` package.
- **Updates for your users.** Upload under **Versions**, promote, and older clients replace themselves on their next launch. It swaps one file, so it suits a one-file PyInstaller `.exe`. [More](https://atlassecurity.site/docs?p=guides/auto-update).
- **Updates for the SDK.** `pip install --upgrade atlas-auth` brings the package forward. From 1.1.2, on a development machine `Atlas.dll` and the binding files also keep themselves current from signed releases, with a rollback if the new DLL will not load. End-user machines never update this way.

When a process ends unexpectedly, the cause is already on disk: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\AtlasAuth\logs\atlas_exit_*.log` holds the reason, file and line. [Reading the log](https://atlassecurity.site/docs?p=diagnostics/logs).

## Atlas Obfuscator

The other half of Atlas protects the compiled file itself. Upload an `.exe` or `.dll` (x64 or x86), choose options and download the protected build. No source and no SDK. [See it work](https://atlassecurity.site/obfuscator), with real captures from protected builds.
